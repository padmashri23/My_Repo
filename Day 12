OUTPUT:
enter the number with comma separated:
1,8,3,95,4,9,5,6,2,7,27,54,86,32,15,98,756,42,31,84,56
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 27, 31, 32, 42, 54, 56, 84, 86, 95, 98, 756]

Cocktail shaker sort, also known as bidirectional bubble sort, cocktail sort, shaker sort (which can also refer to a variant of selection sort), 
ripple sort, shuffle sort, or shuttle sort, is a variation of bubble sort that is both a stable sorting algorithm and a comparison sort. 
The algorithm differs from a bubble sort in that it sorts in both directions on each pass through the list.
This sorting algorithm is only marginally more difficult to implement than a bubble sort, and solves the problem of turtles in bubble sorts.
It provides only marginal performance improvements, and does not improve asymptotic performance;
like the bubble sort, it is not of practical interest (insertion sort is preferred for simple sorts), though it finds some use in education.
